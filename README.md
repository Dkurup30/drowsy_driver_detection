This is a project to determine when a driver is drowsy and alert the driver accoringly.
Here the dataset used is: shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 from http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
Opencv is used for image recognition and simple eucleadian distance is calculated for detecting drowsiness.
